_Jed McCaleb & Chris Larsen_

Prior to becoming the Ripple that we know it today, Ripple actually had a precursor in RipplePay, which was created by Ryan Fugger in 2004. The main idea behind RipplePay was that it was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. It was built with the idea that as they currently are, banks are essentially only taking and giving out loans. Therefore, if a system of trust were to be implemented, a loan could be made and received from other peers in this trust system, completely circumventing the banking industry.

By 2011, Bitcoin, having been around for a couple of years, was gaining traction and followers in RipplePay’s target demographic. It was around this time that Jed McCaleb, an early Bitcoin pioneer who founded the Mt.Gox exchange before selling it, joined RipplePay to tackle some of these issues. Not long after McCaleb’s joining, Ryan Fugger gave RipplePay over to McCaleb. 

The following year, in 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen, former chairman and CEO of E-Loan and founder of Prosper Marketplace, on to OpenCoin, RipplePay’s new name. Also, around this time, with its increasing popularity, Bitcoin was being used as a base currency for settlement on the Ripple network, RippleNet. Along with the usage of Bitcoin, OpenCoin decided to introduce their Ripple gateway structure onto their network, a move that introduced large businesses that people would trust to run the transactions, a sort of compromise between incumbent traditional banking and RipplePay’s original idea of a peer-to-peer network. To cap off a successful 2012, that October, Jesse Powell participated in the first seed round for Ripple, with an investment of $200,000.

Not one to let off, 2013 was an even bigger year for OpenCoin, due to the creating of its XRP token, as well as having another round of venture funding. To begin the year, OpenCoin released the XRP coin, which is similar to Bitcoin in that it relies on a public chain of cryptographic signatures to transact on the network. After setting the supply to 100 billion XRP, OpenCoin intended the cryptocurrency to be utilized by being sent from user to user and could be used for fees such as the transaction fees of using RippleNet. Later that April, OpenCoin received $1.5 million in funding from companies such as Google Ventures, Andreesen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners, FF Angel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, and Vast Ventures.

In a surprising turn of events, that June, McCaleb, after having become less involved in the project, ultimately left OpenCoin altogether. This abrupt exit was because of strategy disagreements between McCaleb and Larsen, with the difference being that Larsen was backed and fully supported by the venture-capital investors. McCaleb, after leaving OpenCoin, went on to start Stellar in 2014, which some say has some of the original ideas that helped form Ripple. To end the very eventful year of 2013, OpenCoin then changed their name to Ripple Labs that September.

In 2015, Ripple Labs then simplified their name even further and changed it to Ripple. Then in September 2016, Ripple raised $55 million in a funding round which was led by Japanese SBI Holdings. After acquiring 10.5% stake in Ripple, Ripple and SBI Holdings began a joint venture, SBI Ripple Asia, which is owned 60% by SBI and 40% by Ripple. This new company is hoping to provide a settlement platform using Ripple’s distributed financial technology. In total, from 2012-2016, Ripple raised $93.6 million from Andreesen Horowitz, GV (Google Ventures), and many more of the top VC firms in Silicon Valley.

Ripple has now gotten to the point where it will consistently find itself as one of the top fintech companies around, even being found in Forbes’ FinTech 50 of 2019. It can be found among other blockchain and cryptocurrency companies such as Bitfury, Circle, Coinbase, and Gemini.

_Ripple: go-to solution for inter-bank transactions?_


Now, what exactly is Ripple attempting to do? Ripple is attempting to become the go-to solution for inter-bank transactions. It is doing so by providing a variety of services as well as the underlying technology that makes it all function.

As a company, Ripple provides three services: xCurrent, xRapid, and xVia. The technology that makes it all function is the usage of RippleNet, Ripple’s own blockchain, and XRP, a cryptocurrency which the transaction fees of the RippleNet are exclusively settled with.  

First, an examination of RippleNet, Ripple’s usage of blockchain technology. What RippleNet is proposing to do is to replace the current system of inter-bank exchange, most notably SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications). Some reasons that the current system will need to change is because, as it stands, it is slow, expensive, and error-prone. To function, banks have to coordinate transfers of value across all of their different internal databases, which is not a quick process. RippleNet would have the advantage over this current system by eliminating friction, speeding up transaction and settlement times, and reducing costs.

What RippleNet is made of is a global network of banks and financial institutions that can send and receive payments on the network. Because it is a singular network, RippleNet can provide a seamless experience for global payments for users. These users being made of platform businesses, corporate treasury, banks and financial institutions, and everyday consumers. Then, participants of RippleNet all abide by the same framework of rules and standards, which helps overcome some of the inefficiencies that the current system produces.

Using RippleNet offers some of the following benefits: access, speed, certainty, and cost. With RippleNet, you get access to a global decentralized network of banks and financial institutions, who are all subject to a unified framework of rules, formats, and governance. You get the speed that RippleNet offers in settling global transactions in seconds, rather than days. Users of RippleNet also minimize risk and are provided network transparency in regard to all network transactions. Lastly, there are benefits of reduced transaction costs when compared to the current system.

Another benefit of transacting with RippleNet, is that with the current system, banks may have to open nostro accounts, which are accounts at foreign banks funded with the local currency. These funds then sit idle until the bank needs to make a payment in that local currency, therefore affecting banks by not being able to use those funds elsewhere. In some cases, some banks may be unable to fund nostro accounts, and would then have to use a third-party to provide liquidity in that local currency, further slowing the process down.

To combat this, Ripple, using RippleNet, proposes that banks move from the current system with all of its disjointed databases to a single distributed global database, the Ripple ledger. With this proposed new system, banks can trade any asset of value with other trusted banks, with all of these transactions contained on a shared ledger. This provides the advantage of fluidity and speed, as well as freeing up capital for banks that would otherwise be tied up.

The other technology that Ripple makes use of is the cryptocurrency of RippleNet, XRP. Similar to Bitcoin, XRP is another cryptocurrency that relies on a public chain of cryptographic signatures to transact on the network. XRP is used to pay fees when you transact on RippleNet. However, unlike Bitcoin, XRP is not collected by anyone and is actually destroyed and ceases to exist. At its inception, 100 billion XRP were created, and due to the protocol rules, no more XRP can ever be created. In that respect, it is a deflationary cryptocurrency.

The main reason for having a cost associated with transactions is to prevent attacks from flooding the ledger, and as another preventative measure for the same reason, a wallet must have a minimum of 20 XRP to be able to transact. A similarity of XRP to Bitcoin is the fact that with both, there is no counterparty risk; however, unlike Bitcoin, XRP clears much faster, in about 4 seconds or less. A benefit of XRP is that it also serves as currency that can bridge any currency, asset, or thing of value in the world, which allows for instant transactions on RippleNet. Any currency that is liquid to XRP, therefore, is liquid to any other currency. Banks, then, ultimately have the option to send assets that are IOU backed on RippleNet or can actually send payments using XRP. While these are two valid options, it may behoove banks to send payments using XRP, as they can be settled much more quickly, as long as the receiving banks accept XRP. The advantage of doing this as opposed to simply sending IOU-backed assets on RippleNet, is that these IOUs must be at some point be settled with actual monetary transfers, thus still relying on the slow current system.

While XRP is similar to Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, there is one big distinction in that instead of using proof-of-work, XRP uses a consensus protocol. This simply means that users of the protocol would have to trust the validators that produce the consensus of all transactions, which, in the case of Ripple, could be argued for, because you would need a trusting relationship for the IOUs to work in the first place.

Now that we understand the underlying technology that Ripple utilizes, exactly what services does Ripple provide? They provide three: xCurrent, xRapid, and xVia.

_Instant and certain settlement with xCurrent_

xCurrent is the flagship product of Ripple. The one that very effectively allows banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking, via RippleNet. The main draw of xCurrent is the speed in which payments are settled, which makes it a good replacement for the existing solutions, such as SWIFT, which takes significantly longer to settlement payments. xCurrent also allows banks to communicate with one another to confirm details prior to the transaction and to confirm delivery afterwards. Also, by using xCurrent, there is a rulebook that ensures there is operational consistency and legal clarity for every transaction.

![](https://cdn.ripple.com/wp-content/themes/ripple-beta/assets/img/icons/img_xrapid_1@2x.png)
_Low cost liquidity with xRapid_

xRapid is similar to xCurrent in that it assists banks in settling transactions across RippleNet, however, it would be using XRP, thus lowering the capital requirements for liquidity. While xCurrent can assist banks in sending and receiving assets, if banks were to send fiat for fiat, it would be more expensive and unsustainable than transacting with XRP, and trading XRP for fiat prior and after the transaction. One big advantage, is that it could free up funds that could potentially be sitting idle in nostro accounts, thus eliminating the need for nostro accounts. Another advantage could be the ability to send small international payments with small fees. One drawback is that it may introduce factors are not positive, such as the volatility of XRP.

![](https://cdn.ripple.com/wp-content/themes/ripple-beta/assets/img/icons/img_xvia_1@2x.png)
_Standard payments interface with xVia_

Lastly, xVia allows banks, and other entities such as corporations and payment providers, to transact using RippleNet with a standard API, and can even include attachments. xVia can also allow you to process payments with tracking and delivery confirmation.

Therefore, with the underlying technology and their services, the two main areas that Ripple has the potential of greatly impacting are removing the need for banks to fund nostro accounts, and circumventing SWIFT with global settlements.

Worldwide, there is more than $27 trillion in capital sitting idle in nostro accounts. Ripple is attempting to free up this capital by providing a service that would allow institutions to transact internationally without worrying in transferring fiat currency for another fiat currency. Through RippleNet, IOUs could be sent from institution to institution and settled quickly, or XRP could be used with less fees simply by being traded for local fiat currency before the transaction and then be traded again after without the need for nostro accounts. This would also assist smaller banks that would otherwise need a third-party liquidity provider to transact. Lastly, it would also circumvent the current SWIFT system of international transfer, which is slow and expensive.

# Landscape:

_Ripple in Forbes' FinTech 50_

As with most things, information does not mean much without some context. Therefore, now that we have a clear understanding of the origin of Ripple, what technology it uses, and what services it provides, it is important that we know what the competitive landscape looks like for context.

Ripple finds itself in an interesting position in that it is in a long-established industry, finance, that has a growing new sub-category in fintech (financial technology), that then partially includes a growing new technology, blockchain.

It is in this small niche of blockchain companies within the growing fintech industry, that Ripple finds itself in company with others such as Bitfury, Circle, Coinbase, and Gemini in Forbes' FinTech 50 for 2019. However, they really aren’t that similar to Ripple in that they offer different things under the blockchain umbrella. For example, Circle, Coinbase, and Gemini are exchanges in which users can trade fiat currency for listed cryptocurrencies. Bitfury, on the other hand, is somewhat similar to Ripple, in that it is a blockchain company, however, they specialize in moving assets across the Bitcoin blockchain, rather than their own network like RippleNet.

Ripple though, is not only competing with growing companies in the blockchain space, it is also competing with established companies making moves into the blockchain space. The most notable example being JP Morgan.

It was announced that JP Morgan would create their own cryptocurrency, a stable coin (meaning it will be pegged to a fiat currency, in this case, the US dollar) called JPM Coin. This was the first instance of an established bank to launch its own cryptocurrency. All is not lost for Ripple though, because they actually defer in various ways. The main difference is that JP Morgan’s cryptocurrency will be exclusive for institutional customers and will be based on a private, permissioned blockchain called Quorum. This makes it vastly different from Ripple, mostly due to the fact that everyday consumers can still utilize the XRP coin that RippleNet uses to settle transaction fees with.

# Results:

_100+ financial institutions have partnered with Ripple_

While it may be tempting to think of Ripple’s success in terms of XRP market cap (currently third, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively), it would not be the full picture of whether Ripple is successful or not. The reason for that is because Ripple is not XRP, and XRP is not Ripple. While Ripple uses XRP as the cryptocurrency to settle transactions that occur on RippleNet, they are separate. Therefore, different measures must be used to determine Ripple’s success. The clearest way is to quantify the current amount of financial institutions that use Ripple as intended.

When quantified, as of 2017, 100+ financial institutions (such as SBI Remit, SEB, and Siam Commercial) have partnered with Ripple to use xCurrent and RippleNet to send cross-border payments. Again, it is important to make note of the fact that they are using xCurrent for the cross-border payments, which does NOT send XRP as a medium between exchanging different fiat currencies.

Now, while it may seem that Ripple is already fairly successful, it is important to acknowledge the fact that they are essentially trying to dethrone SWIFT as the go-to system for sending payments internationally. This may be a tall order as SWIFT has been in place for decades, thus having a significant head start. It also has a lot of infrastructure already in place, so should they look into possibly integrating blockchain technology to their current operations, it may only prove a much more difficult battle for Ripple.

While it may appear to be a difficult battle for Ripple, it may slowly, over time, become a force for SWIFT to fear. In August 2019, Ripple and MoneyGram partnered via MoneyGram deciding to use Ripple’s xRapid to send XRP for cross-border settlements. Time will tell if Ripple successfully over takes SWIFT as the go-to solution for cross-border transactions. Perhaps, in a surprising turn of events, they may even decide to partner, much like Ripple just did with MoneyGram.

# Recommendations:

![](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*W6cRtUSbllcIEMmWUMmv9A.png)

Now that Ripple is making way onto it's initial goal, it might be advisable for Ripple to start to make their marketing material focus on the benefits of everyday consumers to use it as a peer-to-peer transfer of value. While this is what Bitcoin can already do, it seems that slowly over time, Bitcoin is becoming a cryptocurrency used more as a store-of-value than for actual everyday transactions. As it stands, the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap, as of August 2019, are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bitcoin is slowly transitioning from transactions to store-of-value, and Ethereum is providing a platform to program smart contracts. Because of this, XRP could become the cryptocurrency for transactions, exclusively through RippleNet, while still being used to settle the fees of inter-bank transactions. The biggest advantage XRP would have over Bitcoin, would be that the transaction times would clear significantly faster.

The reason this might benefit Ripple is that they would capture an overall bigger market. If their current services (xCurrent, xRapid, xVia) target mostly businesses and established institutions, they could then focus on using XRP for peer-to-peer transactions. While it may not be the only cryptocurrency that would be offering this service, it would certainly be the biggest one by market cap.

Even though XRP is not owned by Ripple, to the general public, they are essentially the same and XRP IS currently exclusively the only cryptocurrency that is able to be used to settle transaction fees on RippleNet. Then, perhaps they could present using XRP on RippleNet as one packaged service for consumers.

A possible second recommendation could be that they implement a service where everyday users of XRP could transact directly with their eligible banks in XRP. These banks could then use the XRP to pay their own transaction fees or transfer the XRP with other banks. If they were then able to provide a simple UX/UI, they could allow users to trade their cryptocurrencies instantly to XRP when transacting with a bank. This idea would mirror how banks currently can trade fiat currency to XRP before sending it to another bank, who would then trade XRP for their local fiat currency.

If Ripple were to use RippleNet to allow users to transact with their bank, one of the only things they may need to provide are wallets for XRP that have a proven identity so that the banks know who exactly they are transacting with. The system could be set up very similar to how current exchanges, such as Coinbase, have their wallets set up. The reason Ripple may need to provide wallets to users is because of current KYC and AML laws. People would likely be open to the idea, seeing as how a lot of current US-based exchanges have the same set of rules in place.
